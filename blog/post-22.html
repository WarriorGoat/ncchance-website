<p>One of the quiet traps for survivors — especially military-connected survivors — is assuming that a "safety plan" means the same thing everywhere because it doesn't.</p>
<p>Many states allow survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault to break a lease with a protective order, police report, or advocate verification. In those places, military advocates and Victim Counsel can often get it done quickly. But some states are different.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, for example, the law requires a safety plan issued by a "qualifying domestic violence or sexual assault program" — not one just drafted by a military Domestic Abuse Victim Advocate (DAVA). The plan must be dated during the tenancy, and explicitly recommend relocation. A solid military safety plan may still fall short — through no fault of the advocate or the survivor.</p>
<h3>Why Congress Acted</h3>
<p>In the FY2020 NDAA, codified at <strong>10 U.S.C. § 1044e</strong>, Congress required that Victim Counsel receive training on the laws and policies of the state(s) in which their installation is located. Not just military law — because housing law, protective orders, and lease termination requirements are <em>state</em> law.</p>
<p>This becomes even more complicated for National Guard survivors. Title 10, Title 32, drill status — it doesn't change the fact that housing law is state law. Federal service doesn't override state landlord-tenant statutes, and survivors can get stuck when systems don't talk to each other.</p>
<h3>The Fix</h3>
<p>The fix isn't complicated, but it is intentional. Military advocates do what they do best — support, plan, protect — then partner with a local DV/SA program to formally issue the plan when state law requires it. <strong>That's what bridging systems looks like in practice.</strong></p>
<p>Military Victim Counsel and Legal Assistance attorneys are welcome to connect directly regarding statutory interpretation or cross-system coordination questions.</p>
