        <h1>Ruth's Truth #6: Military-Connected Victim Representation — What About Civilian Victims?</h1>
        <p class="post-date">July 2025</p>
        <div class="post-body">

<p>While serving in Alaska, I met a local attorney whose daughter was sexually assaulted by an active duty servicemember. He discovered that civilian victims are not eligible for free legal representation under the military's Victim Counsel programs, as are servicemembers and their dependents. He became her advocate, and later, a proponent for civilian attorneys being trained to represent civilian victims in military processes.</p>
<p>The military remains unique in offering free legal counsel to victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, and in some services, sexual harassment. But there is still a need for more trauma-informed, trained legal advocates to represent civilian victims as well, particularly in complex military justice proceedings and in Reserve/dual-jurisdiction cases.</p>
<p>Some good news: training resources and technical support exist. For attorneys and firms interested in exploring the possibility and learning more, check out information about the "Military-Connected Victims Toolkit" from the National Crime Victim Law Institute (NCVLI).</p>
