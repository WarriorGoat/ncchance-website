        <div class="post-body">

<p>Every time another case surfaces involving a doctor who assaults or secretly records patients, the pattern is so predictable — someone tried to warn; someone reported; no one was heard.</p>
<p>Shannon Hough of Shield of Sisters noted on CNN that the biggest problem is simple but devastating: <strong>the system doesn't listen to victims.</strong> In the latest case involving Maj McGraw, it took a male spouse catching the doctor recording his wife during an exam and calling CID himself. Only then was McGraw removed. Then we learned that there were prior reports in Hawaii and Texas, but no one listened and then more were harmed.</p>
<p>Listening isn't complicated. It means believing someone enough to take action: investigate, document, connect them with resources, and give them a path forward. It means honoring their request for a Victims' Counsel—within the 72-hour requirement—and not interviewing them until counsel is present.</p>
<blockquote>"I went in, gave my statement, and walked out with a pamphlet. That was the end of it." ... "They asked if I wanted a Special Victims' Counsel. I said yes — but the SVC didn't even know I existed until a week ago."</blockquote>
<p>Was the victim heard? I hear her now.</p>
<p>Listening on a human level requires patience and space for the full story (and if you are me, hearing aids), even when trauma surfaces in fragments or spans childhood to adulthood and does not seem to be connected to the current situation. But these layers matter. They inform choices, explain levels of participation, and reveal the true scope of harm to which there is at least some remedy.</p>
