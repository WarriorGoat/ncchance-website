<p>After almost 30 years of being a lawyer, just when I think "I've got this, it should be no problem" I realize how much I still have to learn. Recently, while helping a survivor in civilian court, I slammed into a wall that every attorney will hit when there are concurrent military and civilian investigations and proceedings and you need to serve or subpoena someone and/or subpoena documents. Some lessons learned:</p>
<h3>Lesson #1: You Cannot Force Service on Base</h3>
<p>A servicemember or a dependent who lives on base can legally refuse service. SJA offices and Commands can try to facilitate, but they can't compel anyone to take the papers. <em>Real Life: I ended up having to get someone to serve the person off base, which required some PI skills I did not know I had.</em></p>
<h3>Lesson #2: Subpoenas? Not Without the Touhy Dance</h3>
<p>If you need testimony or records, your subpoena means nothing until it goes through the different paths with a full Touhy request. All military departments follow the same legal framework, but each branch has its own implementing regulations and processes. They want everything: case posture, relevance, Privacy Act issues, estimated time. All this takes a lot of time. The 5-day service rule applicable in many states does not apply here.</p>
<h3>Lesson #3: Ongoing Investigations Shut Everything Down</h3>
<p>If a Military Criminal Investigative Organization (MCIO) is involved, access to witnesses or information becomes impossible until the investigation is done.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Try to coordinate service of process with the SJA, but serve off-base when possible. Document your attempts. If a witness who lives on base won't accept service, see if they are willing to testify voluntarily/remotely.</li>
  <li>Start your Touhy request before the court even asks.</li>
  <li>Tell the judge early if there is a military investigation going on, and explain the processes and challenges.</li>
  <li>Keep the victim centered, ensure they have military and civilian victim advocate/victim counsel support, and communicate with all — despite procedural delays.</li>
</ul>
<div class="ruths-truth"><span class="rt-label">Ruth's Truth</span>Civilian courts run on deadlines and expectations. Military regulations run on federal processes and caution. Victims get stuck between systems that do not communicate. Navigating both systems is complicated, and that is a gap to try to help close.</div>
