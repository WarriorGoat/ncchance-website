<p>A year ago, I thought I knew what my "next" looked like — I was wrong.</p>
<p>I had started a remote federal position as a sexual harassment investigator with the National Guard's Office of Complex Investigations. It felt like the right continuation of decades of work inside the system. And then it wasn't.</p>
<p>The day before I was supposed to travel for training, my government travel card was randomly shut off in a nationwide issue, and my flight was canceled. After weeks of debating whether the resignation offer was genuine, I remember thinking, "This is my sign." The next day, I resigned, and a year I didn't plan began.</p>
<p>For the first time in almost 30 years, I slowed down. I spent real time with my family, quietly helped people for little or no money, and added a new flock of chickens who now live in the nicest "Henetentiary" in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Then a younger attorney called and asked if I wanted to take over a new, clean nonprofit focused on victim rights, called CHANCE. Sure. Why not. CHANCE is now in early development and will grow intentionally — but it is not my primary professional focus for 2026. It is part of the longer vision.</p>
<p>What I kept seeing all year was what I've seen my entire career: <strong>The greatest harm often doesn't come only from what happened. It comes from what happens after.</strong> From systems that don't connect, processes people can't access, professionals working hard in silos, and completely preventable breakdowns.</p>
<p>In December, it clicked that I don't want to spend the rest of my days only responding to harm — I want to help prevent the harm that comes from broken systems.</p>
<p><strong>The ground is shifting.</strong> The Feres Doctrine is being challenged, and institutions are being forced to confront accountability in ways we haven't seen before. Survivors are turning to civil litigation. That is where the year ahead comes in.</p>
