<p>In 2012, I was a deployed JAG officer in Egypt when I was part of something I'll never forget. If someone on our camp was sexually assaulted, they had to be transported—often by helicopter—from Egypt to Israel just to receive a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE). That process often took days.</p>
<p>Imagine surviving something so traumatic and being told to stay in the same clothes—clothes containing physical evidence—while waiting to cross a border.</p>
<p>After the second assault on our camp, my commander made a pivotal call: he sent our Physician Assistant back to the U.S. for SAFE training. At that time, the military was just beginning to confront the true scope of sexual assault. Policies were shifting. Legal counsel became available to victims. The UCMJ began evolving. And 12 years later, the systems continue to change—but gaps remain.</p>
<h3>New Policy Alert: Evidence Collection Now Requires a Formal Report</h3>
<p>Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) cannot collect forensic evidence unless a formal report is filed on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DD Form 2910 (sexual assault — non-intimate partner)</li>
  <li>DD Form 2967 (intimate partner violence)</li>
</ul>
<p>Only a SARC (Sexual Assault Response Coordinator) or SAPR Victim Advocate can explain reporting options. Without these forms, no exam can proceed.</p>
<h3>Who Can Get a Full SAFE</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Active-duty service members</li>
  <li>Their dependents</li>
</ul>
<p>These individuals are eligible for complete forensic exams, advocacy, and follow-up care.</p>
<h3>Who Can't</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Retirees:</strong> May receive STI testing/emergency contraception, but not forensic exams.</li>
  <li><strong>Civilians and contractors overseas:</strong> Limited to life-saving triage—no forensic exams or evidence collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>These individuals may have to pay out-of-pocket to transfer elsewhere for care.</p>
<h3>If There's a Delay</h3>
<p>If an advocate cannot arrive within 2 hours, limited evidence (cheek swabs and urine samples) may be collected—but only with informed consent.</p>
<h3>The Defense Health Agency Must</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Review prior forensic exams involving ineligible patients</li>
  <li>Resolve any billing issues that left survivors footing the bill</li>
  <li>Ensure all MTFs follow updated procedures</li>
  <li>Revise policy documents (e.g., DHA-PI 6310.01) to match current DoD policy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why This Still Matters</h3>
<p>We've come a long way since 2012. But these new procedures remind us that access to justice and care remains uneven—especially for those outside formal eligibility—yet still in harm's way.</p>
<p>Whether you're a leader, provider, advocate, or survivor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Know the policies.</li>
  <li>Know your rights.</li>
  <li>Keep pushing for better.</li>
</ul>
