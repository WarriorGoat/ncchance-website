        <h1>Ruth's Truth #15: More "Alternative Justice"</h1>
        <p class="post-date">October 2025</p>
        <div class="post-body">

<p>Most military-connected victims have been told what to do and options that are available if they are assaulted. When making unrestricted reports, victims typically cooperate, give statements, interview, and many participate in proceedings. They ask command for help, ask for accountability, and trust the system will work.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Defense (DoD) FY 2024 Annual Report: there were <strong>8,195 sexual assault reports</strong> made in FY 2024. Of those, 5,169 were unrestricted reports, and 3,026 were restricted reports.</p>
<p>Case dispositions were reported for 4,292 cases. Within those, DoD had sufficient evidence and took disciplinary action in <strong>2,128 cases (about 66%)</strong>. In <strong>1,079 cases, action was precluded</strong> (insufficient evidence, victim elected not to further participate, etc.). <strong>26 cases (less than 1%) were determined to be unfounded.</strong></p>
<p>I have been saying that stats aren't great, but this does not mean that we do not keep fighting and trying. This also does not mean that there are not options for victims to ensure that they are taken care of by the system that failed them.</p>
<p>I was speaking with a former colleague this week, and she called me excited. One of her former clients who went through proceedings to have her offender disciplined (nothing happened), decided she had had enough with the military. With the advice of her counsel when her options were presented, she decided to go through the Medical Evaluation Board process and apply for VA benefits. She was then medically retired, entitling her to the pay and benefits associated. When she received her VA rating, she also became eligible for Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay (CRDP).</p>
<p>In these cases, victims have not only monetary compensation, they have medical care (including mental health); acknowledgement in writing that what happened caused injury and harm; and victims are able to walk away with head held high and benefits they earned intact — even when the system refused or was unable to punish the person who harmed them.</p>
<div class="ruths-truth"><span class="rt-label">Ruth's Truth</span>The MEB and VA claims route are not "consolation prizes" — they are legal acknowledgements that what happened caused real, lasting injury. It is not giving up — it is continuing to fight, choosing to survive, and having victory.</div>
