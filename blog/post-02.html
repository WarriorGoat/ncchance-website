<p>"Why didn't they report?" "Oh, she reported and now is not going to cooperate???" "If it were me, I'd press charges..."</p>
<p>We hear it all the time—but the reality is far more complex.</p>
<p>One of my clients—a survivor with 10 years of military service—was hospitalized years after a sexual assault for suicidal ideations and disclosed the assault.</p>
<ul>
  <li>No victim advocate was assigned.</li>
  <li>He was diagnosed with a personality disorder, and told he'd be discharged with no benefits.</li>
  <li>I ghostwrote for him, helped him report when that did not work, and navigated the investigation.</li>
  <li>Eventually the military reversed the diagnosis — he received a medical discharge (with benefits).</li>
</ul>
<p>He didn't want to report. He did not want to prosecute. He just wanted help—and then spent two years fighting for his life and dignity.</p>
<h3>Why Might a Survivor Choose Not to Report or Prosecute?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>They need services, not a trial.</li>
  <li>They fear retaliation, disbelief, or career-ending discharges.</li>
  <li>The offender is often someone close—like a friend or superior.</li>
  <li>They don't want to "ruin a life"—just prevent more harm.</li>
  <li>Many still care about the offender's family and future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reality check:</strong> According to RAINN, only about 5% of reported individuals will be arrested and only 2.5% will be incarcerated for sex abuse-related offenses.</p>
<p>As advocates, leaders, professionals, and survivors themselves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Document the "why" behind the choices.</li>
  <li>Acknowledge the risks survivors face.</li>
  <li>When you have to tell the story (to participate or not), tell it in a way so others can empathize—like it was their own sibling or child.</li>
</ul>
<div class="ruths-truth"><span class="rt-label">Ruth's Truth</span>Reporting is a "form"—it's not the same as participation. Choosing not to participate doesn't mean the assault didn't happen — it often means it did.</div>
