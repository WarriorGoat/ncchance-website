        <h1>Ruth's Truth #3: Alternative Justice for Survivors</h1>
        <p class="post-date">June 2025</p>
        <div class="post-body">

<p>Not every survivor chooses to participate in a court-martial or trial—and not every case proceeds to prosecution. The legal standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt" is difficult to meet, especially when the case comes down to two voices.</p>
<p>I'll never forget a case in Alaska. My client—a survivor—held her First Sergeant at gunpoint until the police came. The prosecutor hesitated to prosecute, stating that a jury may say to themselves, "If she was really raped, why didn't she shoot him?" Despite incredible resilience and powerful support (including an Alaska State Trooper and an internationally recognized trauma expert testifying at the grand jury), the verdict initially was a hung jury, but rightfully emerged into a conviction: 30 years.</p>
<p>The perpetrator later attempted to stay in the military through an administrative board that was held telephonically from jail—with taxpayer-funded defense counsel. He failed.</p>
<p>I reminded him: <em>"If you hadn't raped my client, you wouldn't be here."</em></p>
<h3>So What Can Alternative Justice Look Like?</h3>
<p>Justice doesn't always mean a courtroom win. Sometimes it looks like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A powerful victim impact statement at an administrative hearing</li>
  <li>Reporting through the CATCH system to help prevent future harm to others</li>
  <li>Submitting a letter of character concern to a state licensing board (with supporting evidence, which could include other victims joining in)</li>
  <li>Using personal trauma to advocate for others</li>
  <li>Creating public awareness—sometimes even through viral platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>An advocate's job is to listen, support, and fight for a victim's individual justice—however it looks for each survivor.</p>
<div class="ruths-truth"><span class="rt-label">Ruth's Truth</span>Justice is not one-size-fits-all. It's deeply personal. It may not always seem "rational" to outsiders, but that's irrelevant.</div>
