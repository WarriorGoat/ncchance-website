<p>This month I was unexpectedly thrown back into the fires of civilian court after being away for 25 years. To be honest, it's been scary and absolutely not what I thought I'd be doing. Before the military, I practiced in North Carolina for about 7 years. I knew the local rules, the judges, the attorneys, the unwritten norms—the "playing field"—and had earned the respect of my peers.</p>
<p>Now, here I am again in NC, but in a different county, with different local rules, new faces, new calendars, e-filing systems (which did not exist the last time I practiced here), courthouse restrictions, and—of all things—no smoking anywhere. More than once I have found myself sitting in my car in a random parking lot, trying to make phone calls and figure out next steps, feeling a little like "Better Call Saul." The way I re-entered this arena has been anything but neat or planned.</p>
<p>But I am learning—fast and hard. And thankfully, I didn't leave behind the 30 years of knowledge, experience, and grit I gained along the way. When I walk into court, I walk in as myself—lighthearted, unpretentious, and willing to ask questions. And I have been met with grace, a few smiles, and even a couple laughs.</p>
<p>The good news in all of this: I am helping someone who is in a desperate situation—someone who would have had no ground to stand on alone. And by absolute providence, timing, and some unexpected reconnections, this landed directly in my lap. I have humbled myself to ask for help when needed, and people have responded with kindness.</p>
<p>This past year, as I've worked toward launching a non-profit focused on representing crime victims and training those doing this work, the mission has become clearer and clearer: <strong>Military-connected victims need legal help. They need advocates who understand both sides of the justice world. They need people who won't look away when things get complicated.</strong></p>
