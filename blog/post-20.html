<p>I've written before about administrative separation boards, but this is about the cost of doing nothing.</p>
<p>After representing 80+ victims, here's the hard truth: <strong>most sexual assault cases in the military will never go to court-martial.</strong> That's not about credibility — it's the reality of a system that requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>On active duty, the Office of Special Trial Counsel assesses cases through a win-loss lens. In the National Guard, civilian systems often make the same calculation. When there is no prosecution, the case goes back to command, and too often what follows is silence.</p>
<p>The easy conclusion becomes: <em>They didn't prosecute, so we don't have to do anything.</em> The leap is wrong, but common.</p>
<p>Separation boards in the military exist because misconduct does not disappear simply because it can't be criminally proven. The burden is lower and the purpose is different. Yet these boards are underused because we sometimes talk ourselves out of accountability, which is where the risk compounds.</p>
<p>As Christine Dunn recently highlighted in a Fort Hood case, when institutions take no action — criminal or administrative — the consequences don't stop with the first victim. When an alleged offender later harms someone else, the question becomes not just what happened, but <strong>what was known and what was done — or not done — to prevent it.</strong></p>
<p>Inaction doesn't just fail survivors. It exposes institutions to real risk for failure to act and failure to protect.</p>
<p>Still, fear shows up: the case doesn't look great; consent is disputed; the facts are messy. And the elephant in the room: Why take this to a board if we could lose? What's everyone going to think if we lose? <strong>These are valid fears.</strong> But when fear becomes the decision-maker, everyone loses.</p>
<p>A recent National Guard case answers that. The lawyers didn't think the case was strong. Even the Special Victim Counsel had doubts. But they prepared anyway — traced grooming, tied the facts together, and told the full story. The result: a finding and a recommendation for a General Discharge. Not because the case was perfect — but because someone refused to let "not prosecutable" become "nothing happened."</p>
