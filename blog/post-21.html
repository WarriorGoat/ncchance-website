<p>New Bern, NC got 18 inches of snow — the most in 100 years — I was the only person out on the golf course with my cross-country skis, looking at the only hill in New Bern, not really expecting anything to happen. It did — and because I showed up again the next day and had carved a loop the day before (similar to the many biathlon penalty loops I did as a participant with the National Guard) — I got to glide around "my" course.</p>
<p>That's how this work feels right now: uncertain, messy, and heavy — and still, especially for victims, we have to keep showing up and not giving up.</p>
<div class="ruths-truth"><span class="rt-label">Ruth's Truth</span>When enough of us show up expecting something to happen, it will. When fear and apathy become the decision-makers, everyone loses.</div>
